# Mini Project 1: Free Time Calculator
The first project for the iOS track. 

## The project will be to build an app that allows a user to input:
- total hours per week they need to sleep
- total hours per week of class time
- total hours per week for meals, showering & getting ready
- total hours per week for other (clubs & work)

 And, the app will calculate and display the hours of free time per week back to the user


## Key Features of the App
*Reference section 4 in the iOS 11 & Swift 4 Udemy Course for tips and guidance*
### 1. An Introduction Screen 
      - displays "Free Time Calculator By: [Name]"
      - has a cool background picture or design

            - total hours per week for meals, showering & getting ready
            - total hours per week for other (clubs & work)
